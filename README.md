## About

This app was designed as a final product for a coding bootcamp in a group of 5 people. The app is designed to help connect musicians together in a social network. The app works by having users post adverts about what they are looking for, be it a new member for there band or just looking for people to play some music together in their spare time. 

Users can look through adverts and then message other users, through an in app instant messaging service, about these adverts to show their interest and arrange to meet up and play. Adverts can be filtered by the distance from the users location, or by the genre of music they are looking to play, and the users list can also be filtered by instruments played or again, distance from current location.

Users can build a profile to help showcase their talents and interests within music, including the intstruments they play and level they play at, their genre preferences and can even link their sound cloud profile and embed a youtube video on to their profile page to further demonstrate their ability.

The app was created as a PWA so that it can be downloaded onto a phone and have a native application experience. The app also features google login for users to sign in easily. 

## Tech Stack

### Back-end

For the back end of the app we implemented Firebase which allowed us to quickly input test information in the firestore database.

### Front-end

For the front end of the app we used Svelte.
